    Catawba College in Salisbury, NC is a private, coeducational liberal arts college established in 1851, affiliated with the United Church of Christ. Our purpose is to enrich the educational experiences of students and to prepare them for productive, meaningful lives of purpose. Our campus is located in historic Salisbury, NC and consists of over 30 buildings on 276 acres. It is a beautiful blend of neogothic architecture set on a shaded hillside adjacent to its own ecological preserve. Centrally located, we are just two hours from the Appalachian Mountains and four hours away from some of the best beaches on the Atlantic Coast.
