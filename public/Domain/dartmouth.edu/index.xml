      <description>&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1769, Dartmouth is a member of the Ivy League and consistently ranks among the worldâs greatest academic institutions. Dartmouth has forged a singular identity for combining its deep commitment to outstanding undergraduate liberal arts and graduate education with distinguished research and scholarship in the Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and its three leading graduate schoolsâthe Geisel School of Medicine, Thayer School of Engineering, and the Tuck School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
